  <h2 class="post" id="post2">The end of <em>"The Grand Tour"</em></h2>
  <h6>Posted on February 6, 2024 </h6>

   <p> Amazon Prime have released the last season of The Grand Tour, the "Sand Job". The last chapter, 
    in which Jeremy Clarckson, James May and Richard Hammond travel to Zimbabue, will arrive to Spain at 
    the end of this year. I am very excited to see the last adventure of these three friends, but it is 
    a shame that after so many years, laughts and extraordinary cars testings, the Zimbabue special 
    chapter will close that legendary series for ever.<br>
    I am looking forward to see what the future holds them, and I am sure that, as well as me, most of 
    you will not never forgive the epic trip these presenters along Top Gear and Grand Tour.

  <h2 class="post" id="post1">New Porsche 918 spyder</h2>
  <h6>Posted on September 20, 2015</h6>

   <p>The new Porsche 918 Spyder is a high performance sport car manufactured by the
      German brand Porsche.The 918 Spyder is a plug-in hybrid powered by a mid- 
      mounted naturally aspirated 4.6 L (4,593 cc) V8 engine, developing 447 kW (608 
      PS; 599 hp) at 8,700 RPM, with two electric engines delivering an additional 210 
      kW (282 hp) for a combined output of 652 kW (875 hp) and 1,280 Nâ‹…m of 
      torque.<br> 
      This new Porsche is the first hybrid one of the company, and I think they have 
      done an excelent job. It is the best car of it's category, and form me, the 918 
      spyder is has one of the most beautiful bodywork of the entire automobile history.
